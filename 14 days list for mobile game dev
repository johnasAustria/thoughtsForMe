if I wanna try to develop mobile games can you give roadmap for 14 days with
TODO tasks for every day. I wanna see for every day what I need to learn
to be able to create simple mobile game with Unity engine. 
I wanna spend no more than three-four hours per day for these activities. 

Certainly! Here is a roadmap for 14 days that outlines some tasks you can work on each
day to learn how to create a simple mobile game with the Unity engine:

Day 1:

    Install the Unity engine and familiarize yourself with the interface.
    Set up a new project and explore the project hierarchy.
    Begin learning about the C# programming language.

Day 2:

    Continue learning about C# programming and practice writing basic code.
    Begin learning about game development concepts such as game objects, components, and prefabs.

Day 3:

    Learn about the Unity Editor and how to use it to create and edit game objects.
    Begin working on a simple prototype for your game using basic game objects and simple mechanics.

Day 4:

    Learn about Unity's physics system and how to use it to create simple gameplay mechanics.
    Continue working on your game prototype and begin implementing basic gameplay mechanics.

Day 5:

    Learn about Unity's audio system and how to use it to add sound effects and music to your game.
    Continue working on your game prototype and begin adding audio to enhance the gameplay
    experience.

Day 6:

    Learn about Unity's animation system and how to use it to create simple animations for your game.
    Begin working on visual assets for your game, such as character models and environment assets.

Day 7:

    Learn about Unity's particle system and how to use it to create special effects for your game.
    Continue working on your game prototype and begin adding visual assets and special effects.

Day 8:

    Learn about Unity's user interface system and how to use it to create a simple UI for your game.
    Begin working on the UI for your game and integrating it into your prototype.

Day 9:

    Learn about testing and debugging in Unity and how to use the debugger to troubleshoot
    problems in your game.
    Continue working on your game prototype and begin testing and debugging your code.

Day 10:

    Learn about version control and how to use a tool like Git to manage your code and assets.
    Begin integrating version control into your workflow and committing your changes regularly.

Day 11:

    Learn about mobile development and how to build and deploy your game to a mobile device.
    Begin testing your game on a mobile device and making any necessary adjustments.

Day 12:

    Learn about mobile optimization and how to optimize your game for different mobile devices.
    Begin optimizing your game for mobile devices and improving performance.

Day 13:

    Learn about mobile monetization and how to monetize your game using techniques such
    as in-app purchases and advertising.
    Begin implementing monetization strategies into your game.

Day 14:

    Continue working on your game and making improvements as needed.
    Start preparing your game for release and submitting it to app stores or other
    distribution platforms.

This roadmap is just a suggestion, and you may need to adjust it based on your
own goals and learning pace. It's also important to keep in mind that learning
how to create a mobile game with the Unity engine can be a significant undertaking,
and it may take longer than 14 days to develop your skills and create a simple game.
